**Some thoughts on Prompt Optimization and Instructional Design for LLM CoT**:

F(Instruction) = P(Chain of Thought) # instruction and rules are designed for LLM CoT

F(CoT) = P(thinking | Instruction) # CoT is the chain of thought, the thinking process of the model

F(Cot) = F(thinking) = P(answer) # After sorted CoT process based on the instruction, the final answer is generated
