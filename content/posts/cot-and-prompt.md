**Some thoughts on Prompt Optimization and Instructional Design for LLM CoT**:

F(Instruction) = P(Chain of Thought) # instruction and rules are designed for LLM CoT

F(CoT) = P(thinking | Instruction) # CoT is the chain of thought, the thinking process of the model

F(Cot) = F(thinking) = P(answer) # After sorted CoT process based on the instruction, the final answer is generated.

Instruction complexity will affect the LLM understand the task, concise one gets better performance.

Divide and conquer is also a good method to optimize the CoT and workflow. Chain of multiple tasks instead of one complex task might be a better idea.
